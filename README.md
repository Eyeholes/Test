NOT FUNCTIONAL.
Currently it only displays the main "log in" page you are supposed to see when first getting in.
We tried multiple times to add the framework as to add another page to the program, as to get you redirected to a dashboard after loggin in, but for whatever reason we didn't manage to get it to work.
We left said traces in the code as prove that we tried but couldn't succed.
After going through the given documentation and looking stuff on our own online, and trying multiple methods, we didn't manage to fix the issue, maybe its a fundamental error in the coding? IDK.
